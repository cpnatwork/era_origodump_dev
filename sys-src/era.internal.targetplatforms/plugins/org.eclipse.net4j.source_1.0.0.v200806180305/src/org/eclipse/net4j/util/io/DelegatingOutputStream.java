/**
 * This class is the superclass of all classes that filter output streams. These streams sit on top of an already
 * existing output stream (the <i>underlying</i> output stream) which it uses as its basic sink of data, but possibly
 * transforming the data along the way or providing additional functionality.
 * <p>
 * The class <code>DelegatingOutputStream</code> itself simply overrides all methods of <code>OutputStream</code> with
 * versions that pass all requests to the underlying output stream. Subclasses of <code>DelegatingOutputStream</code>
 * may further override some of these methods as well as provide additional methods and fields.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> The only difference to {@link java.io.FilterOutputStream} is that <code>DelegatingOutputStream</code>
 * does <b>not</b> override {@link #write(byte[])} or {@link #write(byte[], int, int)} but rather exposes the original
 * implementations of <code>InputStream</code> which call {@link #write(int)} instead of their delegate counterparts.
