/**
 * A <code>DelegatingInputStream</code> contains some other input stream, which it uses as its basic source of data,

 * <code>DelegatingInputStream</code> itself simply overrides all (see note below) methods of <code>InputStream</code>
 * with versions that pass all requests to the contained input stream. Subclasses of <code>DelegatingInputStream</code>
 * may further override some of these methods and may also provide additional methods and fields.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> The only difference to {@link java.io.FilterInputStream} is that <code>DelegatingInputStream</code> does
 * <b>not</b> override {@link #read(byte[])} or {@link #read(byte[], int, int)} but rather exposes the original
 * implementations of <code>InputStream</code> which call {@link #read()} instead of their delegate counterparts.
